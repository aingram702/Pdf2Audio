# Pdf2Audio
Python program that reads a PDF and converts the text to speech, and creates an mp3 with the voice data. Created this so I could listen to books and documents while cutting my grass, or doing stuff around the house. 

This small program converts a PDF file to an audiobook in MP4 format.
